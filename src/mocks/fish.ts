No, their young help keep the bivalve healthy by eating invading parasites! It's a wonderful bit of evolutionary deal making, don't you think? Each one keeping the other safe... Though eating parasites does not sound like a happy childhood... Is that why the fish is so bitter?",

Or, rather, the lack of them! And just what is a barbel, you ask? Well, a barbel looks a little something like a mustache. A runofthemill carp will sport this unsightly "facial hair," while a crucian carp is considerably better groomed! I tried to grow a mustache when I was younger. It never did fill in quite right... All for the best in the end, as mustaches go so much better with noses than with beaks!',
